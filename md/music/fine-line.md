## Best Songs
<hr />

#### Golden

An up-beat song with an extremely catchy chorus.
Harry's vocals stand out very prominently and are used to their full potential.
Absolutely fantastic guitar, with an interesting choice of "_Golden, golden, golden, golden..._" in the bridge.

#### Watermelon Sugar

A classic. 
Very light guitar in the introduction with just enough reverb on Harry's vocals.
The trumpets are a fantastic addition to the chorus.
The almost hypnotic vocals "_I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it_" really add to the bridge and outro.

#### Adore You

A simple song while also being one hell of an earworm.
The layered vocals on the chorus are arguably the strongest on this track.
The guitar solo near the last quarter of the song is fantastic when layered with the "_It's the only thing I'll ever do_".
Easily one of the best tracks on the album.

#### Lights Up

While "Adore You" was one of the best tracks on the album due to its catchiness, "Lights Up" is easily one of the more unique tracks on the album.
Harry's vocals are much wispier on this track but are also bold and hypnotic during the chorus and outro.
The choir is especially mind-blowing during the bridges between verse and chorus.
The production is amazing and highlights every piece of instrumentation this song has to offer.

#### Falling

A slower song with a piano as the main melody.
The lyrics and vocals by Harry are especially powerful on this track.
The lyrics, "_What if I'm someone I don't want around?_" are especially confessional.

#### She

A slower song, but unlike its predecessor, "To Be So Lonely," has a good rhythm and is packed more instrumentally.
The guitar (and especially the solo) is, as always, top-notch and the vocalistic blending in some quieter parts of the song really make this song unique.

#### Sunflower, Vol. 6

A funky, almost hippie-like song with some amazing lyrics.
Definitely a song you can listen to while roaming in a field of sunflowers on a sunny day.
The scatting in the outro makes this song yet another unique track on this album.

#### Canyon Moon

A feel-good song with lyrics reminiscing about love and the amazing feeling of going home after a long time of being away.

#### Fine Line

A longer song and excellent outro to the album.
Starts off with a simple acoustic guitar with Harry's mirrored vocals and eventually builds up to an orchestral finale.

## Okay Songs
<hr />

#### Cherry

A slower song with a banjo as the main melody.
Overall, a good song but lacks in comparison to what came before it.
Almost sounds like it would belong in an indie/romance film.

## Worst Songs
<hr />

#### To Be So Lonely

A slow song with a ukulele as the main melody to go with Harry's bare vocals.
The majority of the song is bare but is also lacking.
The lyrics seem to be mostly about denial of alcoholism, which almost goes back on what the previous track, "Falling," was trying to confess.

#### Treat People With Kindness

Probably one of the worst tracks on the record.
Reminds me of Michael Jackson's "Can You Feel It," but if the choir was lacking cohesion with the main melody.

## Best Songs
<hr />

#### Reputation
A piano ballad with very powerful vocals. Amazing transition into the next track. 

#### Lemon Tree
An acoustic and synth combo with an interesting vibrato and accented "better," almost country-accented? Certainly experimental, but I think it works. Powerful vocals and lyrics about everybody's life seeming sweet and his feeling sour.

#### Wrapped Around Your Finger
An absolute banger on the album. When this was originally leaked I knew it was going to be good. Slightly repetitive, but it works really well. Best part is towards the end where the instrumental is cut, exposing Post's powerful vocals and the eventual building back up into the instrumental with a colorful synth.

#### I Like You ft. Doja Cat
After Post's track "Same Bitches" on _Beerbongs & Bentleys_, post talks about his current girlfriend, someone to ground him in the insanity. Very wispy and mellow track with a catchy chorus. Doja absolutely delivers her feature and makes the track an 11/10 for me. The pan flute near the end wraps this happier track up well.

#### I Cannot Be ft. Gunna
The opposite and duo to "I Like You," Post talks about the struggles of having a relationship. A trap-like instrumental with powerful and melodic vocals. Gunna does his part for his feature and even follows the melody in his former part but for the latter part ends up sounding like he just ran out of coke, but it could be stylistic. Overall, good track.

#### Love/Hate Letter to Alcohol ft. Fleet Foxes
Intro and outro choir are heavenly. The instrumental with deep bass and drums with the choir make an absolute banger track.

#### Wasting Angels ft. The Kid LAROI
Synth track absolutely drowned in reverb. Post's thoughts about where he's been and how far he's come gives the track an inspirational feel. I usually don't like much from Kid LAROI but he absolutely killed on this track. The choir in the middle to the end along with the buildup is, well, angelic. 

#### One Right Now ft. The Weeknd
Don't get me wrong, I love both the Weeknd and Post Malone, but the duo is amazingly underwhelming on this track. The song is good but it's not _great_. Nothing in particular really blew me away. The instrumental is good, with a bass acting as the main melody with hard drums.

## Okay Songs
<hr />

#### Cooped Up ft. Roddy Rich
An amazing track on its own. Roddy Rich absolutely fucks up the flow with his abysmal lyrics:
> Shit.
> 
> Gotta pull up.
> 
> Pull up.
> 
> Imma pull up.
> 
> I pull up.

Absolutely garbage lyrics and flow, absolutely abysmal. This track was going to be on the Best Songs tier until this goofy goober lookin' ahhh tried to make the shittiest feature possible and won in a landslide. I cannot even fathom how Post took a listen and was like "yeah this shit is :fire:." This is even worse than Young Thug's feature on "Goodbyes". Absolutely irredeemable. Go back to your one hit wonder "The Box" you _eeh err_ lookin mf.

#### Euthanasia
A good song with a simplistic instrumental. Nothing really stood out with this song, but nothing really made it bad either.

#### When I'm Alone
Good song with a typical drum and beat instrumental. Vocals were good but Post's falsetto on this track was a bit of a miss. 

#### Waiting For A Miracle
Slow song with a simple instrumental, piano chords. Post's vocals are drowning in reverb, but the lyrics are pretty good.

#### New Recording 12, Jan 3, 2020
A simple song with an acoustic instrumental w/ rough vocals from Post. An incredibly short track, only a minute and a half. Sounds like this was the inspiration for the album, given the date.

## Worst Songs
<hr />

#### Insane
A really underwhelming song with some questionable lyrics. I'll post the questionable lyrics below just b/c they're actually pretty funny.

> Yeah we both got a car but it's different
> 
> Yeah we both got a house but it's different
> 
> Yeah we both got teeth but it's different
> 
> I wanna see somethin' in a short skirt please
> 
> I wanna see somethin' in a shirt skort please
> 
> ...
> 
> Second verse, second verse (yay)
> 
> Second verse, second verse (again)

Truly the Motley Crew of the album but less? awful.

## Best Songs
<hr />

#### Music For a Sushi Restaurant
The instrumental is quite good, the acapella makes it even better. 
However, the exciting intro is almost a bit much for the underwhelming vocals. 
The scatting also feels a bit out of place? 
The instrumental more than makes up for both of these points, though.

#### Late Night Talking
The vocal style used in this song is much better than _Music For a Sushi Restaurant_. 
The instrumental is cheery and the chorus is really catchy. 
The outro with the lyrics, "_All This. Late Night. Talking._" made the song really stand out.

#### As It Was
Fantastic song. 
Cheery upbeat drum, guitar, and synth instrumental. 
Vocals and lyrics were really well done. 
I can see why this was put out as a single before the album's eventual release.

#### Little Freak
A slower, but good song. 
Light acoustic guitar and very light drum track. 
The layering of the vocals and the melody brings this song together.

#### Daydreaming
A great instrumental, the vocal layering with the piano near the end of the song makes it pop, although the chorus was shy of "catchy".

#### Keep Driving
A nice melody, heartwarming lyrics, good flow. 
Definitely feels like a cold winter day with the heat on in the car.

#### Love Of My Life
A perfect outro to the album. 
Dramatic synth and melody along with Harry's very up-front vocals and lyrics make this song really pop out from the rest.

## Okay Songs
<hr />

#### Grapejuice
A slower song, although not perfect, does have a good guitar rift near the ending that makes up for the feeling of 'something's missing' on this track.

#### Daylight
A shorter song with heavy guitar and drums. 
The vocal style is light and wispy during the chorus, but overall the song was pretty forgettable.

#### Matilda
Based on the book/movie adaptation. 
This track is good, but barebones as well (some would argue that this track is probably better the way it is, and for the most part I agree). 
This track consists of only Harry's vocals, an acoustic guitar, and near the end, a piano.
Probably one of the better songs in this category, but just shy of being in the best songs list.

#### Satellite
Slower song in the beginning but ramps up towards the end. 
Overall, it wasn't that memorable.

## Worst Songs
<hr />

#### Cinema
A funkier song, with underwhelming vocals as well as underwhelming and even cringe-y lyrics. 
Specifically, "_Do you think I'm cool, too?_" 
Not sure why, but it just rubs me the wrong way. 
Overall, the song feels unfinished with the very large pause between the chorus and the bridge.

#### Boyfriends
Another barebones song w/ acoustic guitar and Harry's layered vocals. 
The reversed vocals in the beginning were an...interesting? choice. 
The melody isn't bad but the song in general is very underwhelming and probably one of the weaker tracks on the album.

# Album Reviews

Music is a large driving factor for me.
While I do anything, whether in the car, in the store, on my computer, I'm always listening to music.
So, I've dedicated a part of my portfolio website to album reviews.
Just like most art, I like to review the entire piece as a whole, so I won't be reviewing singles.
Below I'll explain how I rate albums and tally up the final score.

## How I Rate Albums

Each song will be put in one of the three categories:

| Category Name | Points (%)   | Comments                                                           |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Best Songs    | +1 (100%)    | These songs are the best of the best and should be given a listen. |
| Okay Songs    | +0.5 (50%)   | These songs were good but had flaws.                               |
| Worst Songs   | +0.25 (25%)  | These songs were, in my opinion, not good or had many flaws.       |

From there, all the points are summed up and divided by the total number of songs on the album.

```c
Score Percentage = ((Best Songs) + (Okay Songs) + (Worst Songs)) / Tracks
```

<hr />
<h4 id="reputation">Reputation</h4>
<p>A piano ballad with very powerful vocals. Amazing transition into the next track. </p>
<h4 id="lemontree">Lemon Tree</h4>
<p>An acoustic and synth combo with an interesting vibrato and accented "better," almost country-accented? Certainly experimental, but I think it works. Powerful vocals and lyrics about everybody's life seeming sweet and his feeling sour.</p>
<h4 id="wrappedaroundyourfinger">Wrapped Around Your Finger</h4>
<p>An absolute banger on the album. When this was originally leaked I knew it was going to be good. Slightly repetitive, but it works really well. Best part is towards the end where the instrumental is cut, exposing Post's powerful vocals and the eventual building back up into the instrumental with a colorful synth.</p>
<h4 id="ilikeyouftdojacat">I Like You ft. Doja Cat</h4>
<p>After Post's track "Same Bitches" on <em>Beerbongs & Bentleys</em>, post talks about his current girlfriend, someone to ground him in the insanity. Very wispy and mellow track with a catchy chorus. Doja absolutely delivers her feature and makes the track an 11/10 for me. The pan flute near the end wraps this happier track up well.</p>
<h4 id="icannotbeftgunna">I Cannot Be ft. Gunna</h4>
<p>The opposite and duo to "I Like You," Post talks about the struggles of having a relationship. A trap-like instrumental with powerful and melodic vocals. Gunna does his part for his feature and even follows the melody in his former part but for the latter part ends up sounding like he just ran out of coke, but it could be stylistic. Overall, good track.</p>
<h4 id="lovehatelettertoalcoholftfleetfoxes">Love/Hate Letter to Alcohol ft. Fleet Foxes</h4>
<p>Intro and outro choir are heavenly. The instrumental with deep bass and drums with the choir make an absolute banger track.</p>
<h4 id="wastingangelsftthekidlaroi">Wasting Angels ft. The Kid LAROI</h4>
<p>Synth track absolutely drowned in reverb. Post's thoughts about where he's been and how far he's come gives the track an inspirational feel. I usually don't like much from Kid LAROI but he absolutely killed on this track. The choir in the middle to the end along with the buildup is, well, angelic. </p>
<h4 id="onerightnowfttheweeknd">One Right Now ft. The Weeknd</h4>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love both the Weeknd and Post Malone, but the duo is amazingly underwhelming on this track. The song is good but it's not <em>great</em>. Nothing in particular really blew me away. The instrumental is good, with a bass acting as the main melody with hard drums.</p>
<h2 id="okaysongs">Okay Songs</h2>
<hr />
<h4 id="coopedupftroddyrich">Cooped Up ft. Roddy Rich</h4>
<p>An amazing track on its own. Roddy Rich absolutely fucks up the flow with his abysmal lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Shit.</p>
  <p>Gotta pull up.</p>
  <p>Pull up.</p>
  <p>Imma pull up.</p>
  <p>I pull up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely garbage lyrics and flow, absolutely abysmal. This track was going to be on the Best Songs tier until this goofy goober lookin' ahhh tried to make the shittiest feature possible and won in a landslide. I cannot even fathom how Post took a listen and was like "yeah this shit is :fire:." This is even worse than Young Thug's feature on "Goodbyes". Absolutely irredeemable. Go back to your one hit wonder "The Box" you <em>eeh err</em> lookin mf.</p>
<h4 id="euthanasia">Euthanasia</h4>
<p>A good song with a simplistic instrumental. Nothing really stood out with this song, but nothing really made it bad either.</p>
<h4 id="whenimalone">When I'm Alone</h4>
<p>Good song with a typical drum and beat instrumental. Vocals were good but Post's falsetto on this track was a bit of a miss. </p>
<h4 id="waitingforamiracle">Waiting For A Miracle</h4>
<p>Slow song with a simple instrumental, piano chords. Post's vocals are drowning in reverb, but the lyrics are pretty good.</p>
<h4 id="newrecording12jan32020">New Recording 12, Jan 3, 2020</h4>
<p>A simple song with an acoustic instrumental w/ rough vocals from Post. An incredibly short track, only a minute and a half. Sounds like this was the inspiration for the album, given the date.</p>
<h2 id="worstsongs">Worst Songs</h2>
<hr />
<h4 id="insane">Insane</h4>
<p>A really underwhelming song with some questionable lyrics. I'll post the questionable lyrics below just b/c they're actually pretty funny.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yeah we both got a car but it's different</p>
  <p>Yeah we both got a house but it's different</p>
  <p>Yeah we both got teeth but it's different</p>
  <p>I wanna see somethin' in a short skirt please</p>
  <p>I wanna see somethin' in a shirt skort please</p>
  <p>…</p>
  <p>Second verse, second verse (yay)</p>
  <p>Second verse, second verse (again)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly the Motley Crew of the album but less? awful.</p>]]></description><link>https://alyssaphacker.com/music/twelve-carat-toothache</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://alyssaphacker.com/music/twelve-carat-toothache</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Kristensen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2022 20:38:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Harry's House]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="bestsongs">Best Songs</h2>
<hr />
<h4 id="musicforasushirestaurant">Music For a Sushi Restaurant</h4>
<p>The instrumental is quite good, the acapella makes it even better. However, the exciting intro is almost a bit much for the underwhelming vocals. The scatting also feels a bit out of place? The instrumental more than makes up for both of these points, though.</p>
<h4 id="latenighttalking">Late Night Talking</h4>
<p>The vocal style used in this song is much better than <em>Music For a Sushi Restaurant</em>. The instrumental is cheery and the chorus is really catchy. The outro with the 'All This. Late Night. Talking.' made the song really stand out.</p>
<h4 id="asitwas">As It Was</h4>
<p>Fantastic song. Cheery upbeat drum, guitar, and synth instrumental. Vocals and lyrics were really well done. I can see why this was put out as a single before the album's eventual release.</p>
<h4 id="littlefreak">Little Freak</h4>
<p>A slower, but good song. Light acoustic guitar and very light drum track. The layering of the vocals and the melody brings this song together.</p>
<h4 id="daydreaming">Daydreaming</h4>
<p>A great instrumental, the vocal layering with the piano near the end of the song makes it pop, although the chorus was shy of "catchy".</p>
<h4 id="keepdriving">Keep Driving</h4>
<p>A nice melody, heartwarming lyrics, good flow. Definitely feels like a cold winter day with the heat on in the car.</p>
<h4 id="loveofmylife">Love Of My Life</h4>
<p>A perfect outro to the album. Dramatic synth and melody along with Harry's very up-front vocals and lyrics make this song really pop out from the rest.</p>
<h2 id="okaysongs">Okay Songs</h2>
<hr />
<h4 id="grapejuice">Grapejuice</h4>
<p>A slower song, although not perfect, does have a good guitar rift near the ending that makes up for the feeling of 'something's missing' on this track.</p>
<h4 id="daylight">Daylight</h4>
<p>A shorter song with heavy guitar and drums. The vocal style is light and wispy during the chorus, but overall the song was pretty forgettable.</p>
<h4 id="matilda">Matilda</h4>
<p>Based on the book/movie adaptation. This track is good, but barebones as well (some would argue that this track is probably better the way it is, and for the most part I agree). This track consists of only Harry's vocals, an acoustic guitar, and near the end, a piano. Probably one of the better songs in this category, but just shy of being in the best songs list.</p>
<h4 id="satellite">Satellite</h4>
<p>Slower song in the beginning but ramps up towards the end. Overall, it wasn't that memorable.</p>
<h2 id="worstsongs">Worst Songs</h2>
<hr />
<h4 id="cinema">Cinema</h4>
<p>A funkier song, with underwhelming vocals as well as underwhelming and even cringe-y lyrics. Specifically, "Do you think I'm cool, too?" Not sure why, but it just rubs me the wrong way. Overall, the song feels unfinished with the very large pause between the chorus and the bridge.</p>
<h4 id="boyfriends">Boyfriends</h4>
<p>Another barebones song w/ acoustic guitar and Harry's layered vocals. The reversed vocals in the beginning were an…interesting? choice. The melody isn't bad but the song in general is very underwhelming and probably one of the weaker tracks on the album.</p>]]></description><link>https://alyssaphacker.com/music/harrys-house</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://alyssaphacker.com/music/harrys-house</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Kristensen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2022 18:11:47 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
